Create a tiger skin shirt pattern that closely resembles the texture and color of a real tiger's skin. The pattern should feature orange and black stripes that are approximately two inches wide and spaced about an inch apart. The overall pattern should be large enough to cover the front and back of a shirt. Please ensure that the pattern is beautifully color-graded with vivid colors, and includes intricate and hyper-detailed details to make it look as realistic as possible.
